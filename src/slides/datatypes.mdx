JavaScript data types and structures

Primitive types

- undefined (typeof instance === "undefined")
- Boolean (typeof instance === "boolean")
- Number (typeof instance === "number")
- String (typeof instance === "string")
- Bigint (typeof instance === "bigint")
- Symbol (typeof instance === "symbol")

<Notes>
  The latest version of ECMA script defines 9 data types and structures in built
  into JavaScript These can be categorized into:- Primitive types, Structural
  types and the Structural Root primitive
</Notes>

---

Structural types

- Object (typeof instance === "object")
- Function (typeof instance === "function")

<Notes>
  Define containers of primitive or structural types. <br />
  <br />
  Object - (a structural type for any constructed object instance i.e new
  Object, new Array, new Map e.t.c almost everything made with `new` key word).{' '}
  <br />
  <br />
  Function - non-data structure. Though every function is derived from the
  Object constructor
</Notes>

---

Structural Root primitive

- null (typeof null === "object"). A special primitive type whose value indicates that object is not inherited.

<Notes>
  undefined - means something that does not yet exist or doesn't exist anymore{' '}
  <br />
  null - something (a structure) that exists but its empty
</Notes>

Why are we looking at data types?

I thought this was a `useCallback/useMemo` talk. ðŸ¤”

By value vs By reference.

Primitive types are stored by value.

```js
let a = 10;
let b = 10;
console.log(a); // logs 10
console.log(b); // logs 10
console.log(a == b); // logs true
console.log(a === b); // logs true

const getAge = () => 10;
const c = getAge();
const d = getAge();
console.log(c); // logs 10
console.log(d); // logs 10
console.log(c == d); // logs true
console.log(c === d); // logs true
```

<Notes>
  If two or more variables holding a primitive type have the same value, they
  will be equal to each other
</Notes>

---

Structural types are stored by reference

```
const a = { age: 12};
const b = { age: 12};
console.log(a); // logs { age: 12 }
console.log(b); // logs { age: 12 }
console.log(a == b); // logs false
console.log(a === b); // logs false

const getInfo = ()=>({ age: 12 });
const c = getInfo();
const d = getInfo();
console.log(c); // logs { age: 12 }
console.log(d); // logs { age: 12 }
console.log(c == d); // logs false
console.log(c === d); // logs false
console.log(Object.is(c,d)) // logs false
```

<Notes>
  - c and d are created by the same function but different function call. Every
  time we call the function a new object will be created. They hold the same
  value but are stored at different locations in memory hence shallow comparison
  of the two objects will be false <br />- In the context of react, if you have
  an object or array in a function component, a new value will be created
  whenever this function is re rendered except if you memoize it
</Notes>

Mutating values stored by reference

```
let a = { age: 12 };
let b = a;
b.height = 15;
console.log(a === b); // logs true
console.log(a); // logs {age: 12, height: 15}
console.log(b); // logs {age: 12, height: 15}

b = { age: 12};
console.log(a === b); // logs false
console.log(a); // logs {age: 12, height: 15}
console.log(b); // logs {age: 12}
```

<Notes>
  The reference of a is assigned to b. And when b is changed. The value that
  that address in memory is changed hence a is changed. If we assign a a new
  value to b, b will now have a new address in memory

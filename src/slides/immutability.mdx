Immutability

Data structures whose structure or the data they hold can't be changed are known as Immutable data structures.

Structural types can be mutated as seen before. 


But maybe there is a way to enforce Immutability in JS......?

Objects

```js
let b = { age: 12 };
const c = b;

// instead of
b.height = 15;
console.log(Object.is(c,b)); // true

// do
b = {...b, height: 15}; // spread syntax
console.log(Object.is(c,b)); // false

// or 
b = Object.assign({}, b, { height: 15 }); // don't forget the first empty object
console.log(Object.is(c,b)); // false
```


<Notes>
One way to enforce immutability is by ensuring that we create a new data structure instead of changing the one that already exists.
<br />
Using the spread syntax or Object.assign ensures  creating a new value in memory whose address is assigned to b, hence b no longer references its initial address in memory but a new one.

Arrays

```js
let a = [{name: "a"}, {name: "d"}];
const b = a;

// instead of
a.push({ name: "e"})
console.log(Object.is(a, b)); // true
console.log(a); // [{name: "a"}, {name: "d"}, { name: "e"}]
console.log(b); // [{name: "a"}, {name: "d"}, { name: "e"}]

// do
a = [...a, {name: "z"}]; // or a.concat([{ name: "z" }])
console.log(Object.is(a, b)) // false
console.log(b); // [{name: "a"}, {name: "d"}, { name: "e"}]
console.log(a); // [{name: "a"}, {name: "d"}, { name: "e"}, {name: "z"}]
```

<Notes>
- When clone a into a new early before modification, we ensure that its initial value is never modified <br />
- In this case our target in on the outside data structure (the array) when adding or removing elements from its we ensure its immutable by creating a new array and add a new value to it instead of just adding the new value to the already existing array.
</Notes>

Nested structural types

```js
let a = [{name: "a"}, {name: "d"}];
const b = a;

// instead of 
a[0].name = "bill"
console.log(Object.is(a, b)) // true
console.log(a); // [{name: "bill"}, {name: "d"}]
console.log(b); // [{name: "bill"}, {name: "d"}]
console.log(Object.is(a[0],b[0])); // true

// do
a = a.map((p, i)=>i === 0?{...p, name: "num"}:p);
console.log(Object.is(a, b)) // false
console.log(a); // [{name: "num"}, {name: "d"}]
console.log(b); // [{name: "bill"}, {name: "d"}]
Object.is(a[0], b[0]); // false
```

Why immutability?

- Certain features like undo or redo which might require access to the state of a data structure at a particular point in time become easy to implement
- Some complex things become simple and are faster to do e.g detecting whether something changed.

> It comes at a memory cost. 

<Notes>
- Its just enough to use `Object.is` instead of looping through items of an array or keys of an object to determine whether anything changed. <br />
- Immutable data structures take a lot of memory hence using them is trading memory for time under the hood

Take me to hooks?

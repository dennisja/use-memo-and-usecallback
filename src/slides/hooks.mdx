Fuctional components

Were state less before introduction of hooks.
Always re rendered when there parents did until introduction of React.memo

---

Demo

<Notes>
  - React.memo is a HOC <br /> - Only checks for prop changes
  <br /> - It shallow compares all objects passed to the component as props
  <br /> - Takes a function to compare props returns true if the previousProps
  and the nextProps are equal
  <br />- Demo starts with a counter that re renders every time the parent changes.
  (use memoized counter to stop this)
</Notes>

React.memo...

Using it with propsAreEqual is similar to using a class component with componentDidUpdate.
Hard to maintain and if you forget to update propsAreEqual when you introduce a new prop, you may introduce a bug.
Also deep comparisons are kind of expensive and hard to do.

<Notes>
  - Continue the demo and change memoized counter to take an object. To show
  that it continues to re render - <br /> Use propsAre equal to fix that
</Notes>

Conclusions

- PureComponents and memoization appear to be more maintainable than Component and shouldComponentUpdate
- React.memo and memoization also appear to be more maintainable than using React.memo and propsAreEqual
- For memoization to work:-
  - The variables used to re calculate a value should be passed as props
  - Avoid passing structural types unless they don't change i.e if you pass an array, object or function it should be a cached value or else memoization won't work.

---

What if memoization was inbuilt into react?

---

useMemo

```js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

Returns a memoized value.
Useful when:-

- passing such a value to child components that rely on reference equality to prevent re rendering
- passing such a value to other hooks that depend on reference equality to rerun e.g. useCallback, useEffect, useMemo
- computing an expensive operation that may block rendering

<Notes>
  - if changes in deps can't be detected by reference equality it might be buggy{' '}
  <br /> - if you don't pass the correct dependencies it might as well be buggy{' '}
  <br /> if you miss a dependence, you might get stale values
</Notes>

useCallback

```js
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

Useful when passing callbacks to:-

- optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary re renders
- other hooks that depend on reference equality to rerun i.e useEffect, useMemo, useCallback
- when you just want to prevent creating a new function every time a component is re rendered

<Notes>
  - Takes a function and its dependencies and returns a memoized version of the
  callback. Only changes if deps change.
  <br /> - The changes in dependencies should be detected by reference equality i.e
  passing an array/object/function that is generated every time a component re renders
  will generate a new cal back every time hence useCallback will be of no purpose
  <br /> - Was not needed in class components because most of the times
  callbacks could be cached on the component instance <br /> If you miss a
  dependency, you might get a stale callback
</Notes>

Demo

Are these required?
Yes and no.

<Notes>
  - React works without these hooks but you might land into issues where. - you
  have unnecessary re renders, these might not be problematic but might cause
  certain issues if you are implementing something like tracking, you might end
  up with the wrong analytics <br />- If you want to run an effect but depends
  on an un memoized value, it might fire many more times that you expect it to
  <br />- If you pass un memoized structural values to a component, it will always
  re render even if you don't want it to unless you do a deep comparison which we
  don't want

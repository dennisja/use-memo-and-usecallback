Well done on the demo, show me the hooks!!!

---

I wish i could, ðŸ˜…

---

Before hooks

---

Class components

Could only re render if there props/state changed if they are pure components or always otherwise

<Notes>
  - PureComponents just class components that extend the PureComponent class
  from react <br />- Other components just extend Component
</Notes>

Demo

PureComponent vs Component re render

<Notes>
  Talk about how pure component only re renders if the parent component changes
</Notes>

Demo

PureComponent & shouldComponentUpdate

<Notes>
  - We have two pure components one with object props and one with individual
  props <br />- The one with object props can be stopped from re rendering by
  converting it to inherit from Component and implement `shouldComponentUpdate`
  or just use memoization.
</Notes>

---

shouldComponentUpdate pitfalls

- Comparison could become tricky if the props to depend on become many
- Maintainability was hard as every time you introduce/remove a prop, this method might have to be updated as well

e.t.c (doesn't mean "End of my" typing capacity)

---

What if there was another way to prevent the re renders?

Only if you could read the memo. ðŸ“‹

---

Memoizaton demo

<Notes>
  - The component re renders whenever the parent component changes <br /> - The
  behaviour can be changed if we memoize the object prop passed to the component
</Notes>

---

Memoization

- Maintainability
- Using memoize one is the equivalent of using the `useMemo` hook
- We didn't need useCallback because the event handles were cached on the component instance

> Note: The props a function depend on to recalculate the values have to be passed as params to the memoized function

<Notes>
  - It comes at a cost of memory <br />- Its easier to maintain in comparison to
  shouldComponentUpdate
  <br />
</Notes>

What about functional components?

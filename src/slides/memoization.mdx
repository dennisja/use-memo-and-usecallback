Memoization

Storing the result of expensive function calls and returning the cached values when the same inputs occur again

For it to work, the memoized function should be a pure function.

---

What about purity?

A function is pure iff:-
- It returns the same output for the same inputs
- It doesn't modify anything outside its scope i.e changing a global, variable, logging, network calls e.t.c

Memoization example

```jsx
const cache = {}

const addOne = (num)=>{
    // return cached value
    if(num in cache) return cache[num];

    const result = num + 1; // expensive calculation
    cache[num] = result; // cache value depending on args
    return result;
}
```

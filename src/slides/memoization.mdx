Memoization

Storing the result of expensive function calls and returning the cached values when the same inputs occur again

For it to work, the memoized function should be a pure function.

---

What about purity?

A function is pure iff:-

- It returns the same output for the same inputs
- It doesn't modify anything outside its scope i.e changing a global, variable, logging, network calls e.t.c

---

Memoization example

```jsx
const cache = {};

const addOne = num => {
  // return cached value
  if (num in cache) return cache[num];

  const result = num + 1; // expensive calculation
  cache[num] = result; // cache value depending on args
  return result;
};
```

Demo

<Notes>
  - The memoized function takes a few milli-seconds to run and 0 seconds the
  next time you press the button <br />- Avoid using a value greater than 40
  your browser might hang - The un memoized value takes a lot of seconds and the
  value doesn't change
</Notes>
